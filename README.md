# Meta Nav

A Firefox extension that adds keybindings (`Alt-[` and `Alt-]`) to
navigate to previous and next pages when the current web page
specifies `<link rel="prev" href="...">` or `<link rel="next"
href="...">` meta elements.

## Installing

Mozilla's add-ons site is preventing me from getting this add-on
signed, saying my email address is bad. I haven't heard back yet.

In the meantime, you can go to `about:debugging` and select the
`manifest.json` for temporary installation.
